title: Moving My Blog To a Static Website

Hi, This is the first day that my new blog site and domain have been established. The new site is for sharing thoughts on specific problems, sharing works that I have done as well as introducing myself.

The previous site that I developed in my high school is no longer available, and blog posts are too insignificant to repost. Thus this site only contains posts from now on and some works not previously published before this date.

Now my blog is powered by [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), and operated by Github Pages (might change in the future). This is one of the static site frameworks that fit me the most. Several blogs indicating measures and pitfalls on establishing a Hexo site may be posted.

Hope it would operate well.
